## Instructions for running the DataMap-Generator

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run `npm insatll` in the terminal

## Requirements for generating a DataMap specification for your application

- Your services should expose an OpenApi specification file written in JSON, which is reachable through HTTP

## Steps for generating a DataMap specification

1. Run the application as described in the [instructions section](#instructions-for-running-the-dataMap-generator)
2. Send a POST request to the 'http://localhost:8000/specification/generate' with the following request body:

```json
{
    "urls" : [
       .... //the OpenApi specification files of your services
    ],
    "fileName": "yourFileName"
}
```

- The `urls` is a required parameter and is an Arry of strings, which are the urls of the specification files in your service.
- The `fileName` is an optional parameter and it is the name which the file will be saved under. If not provided, the file name will be autogenerated

3. On success, the specification file will be saved under the '/specifications' folder in the root directory of the DataMap-Generator
